II. How to run an experiment:

1) Choose one folder (attacks) and open two terminals (server and client), for instance:

 cd experiments/get-flood/

In one, run the script of the server

 ./run-server-example.sh

In other, run the script of the client:

 ./run-client-example.sh

Results are displayed once the verification task is completed. The servers will continue to run waiting for further simulation requests.

III. There is a file called success.quatex in each folder within of experiments, as following:

query( ) = { s.rval(x) } ;
eval E[ # query( ) ] ;

Where x can be classified as follows:

1 => Number of clients
2 => Client success ratio
3 => Number of attackers
4 => Network Traffic
5 => TTS (The average TTS is the average time it takes for a successful client to receive an ACK from the server )

This code is based on the strategy developed by Jonas Eckhardt and Tobias MÃ¼hlbauer.
